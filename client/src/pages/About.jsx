            <p>Keyboard Warriors is a responsive typing test which combines aspects from applications like <a href="https://monkeytype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Monkey Type</a> and <a href="https://play.typeracer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TypeRacer</a> within a reaction speed test framework.</p>
