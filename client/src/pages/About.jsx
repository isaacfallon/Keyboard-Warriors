            <p>Welcome to Keyboard Warriors!</p>
            <br />
            <p>I built this from a fun idea I had to combine a typing game with a reaction speed test.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I'm an avid user of popular typing apps like <a href="https://monkeytype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Monkey Type</a> and <a href="https://play.typeracer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TypeRacer</a> but also have good memories playing games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Typing of the Dead</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/398850/Epistory__Typing_Chronicles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Episory: Typing Chronicles.</a></p>
            <br />
            <p>In my opinion, typing properly has become a bit of a lost art following the rise in popularity of mobile phones, meaning that a lot of people - especially the young Gen Z-ers - can type well with their thumbs on a screen but not properly with all ten fingers on a keyboard.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Not only do I think that typing fast and accurately is fun, but it also provides benefits for many other aspects of your life.</p>
            <br />
            <p>So I hope you can have some fun with this and channel your own inner Keyboard Warrior (just ideally not the kind that posts aggressive and offensive comments on the internet).</p>
