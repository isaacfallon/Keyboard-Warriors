## Description
            
Keyboard Warriors is a responsive typing test which analyses a user's typing proficency and reaction speed.

The application is built using the complete MERN-stack (MongoDB back end, GraphQL API, Express.js & Node.js server, React front end) and utilises the npm package 'an-array-of-english-words'. 

I built this project as a fun way for users to practice their typing abilities while keeping track of their previous scores to assist with improvement. 

By completing this project, I now understand the nuances of how to translate front and back-end data through a MERN-stack environment.

## Contributing

- To get the React countdown timer working properly, I referenced the following [Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59178634/react-5-seconds-countdown-with-hooks), with the answer provided by user Francesco Clementi serving as the inspiration for my implementation using React Hooks.

- To supply random words for the application, I utilised this public [npm package: 'an-array-of-english-words'](https://www.npmjs.com/package/an-array-of-english-words).
